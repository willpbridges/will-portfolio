### Lessons & Takeaways

Our web dev final project was the culmination of everything we had learned and worked on in our assignments during the semester. By that point in the course, we were experienced in deploying websites with nginx and building single-page applications in Phoenix and React, and we were now tasked with building our most complex application yet. This project took place during the pandemic, so we spent a lot of time collaborating over Zoom to get it done. Our two biggest challenges were tracking monster progress at all times and writing the Elixir code that interacted with the Twitter API, but we had a very capable team, and with the time and effort we put into the project, it was a great success.
