### About

Card Crossed Lovers is a visual novel with puzzle elements and multiple endings. The player encounters a husband and wife with a troubled marriage and must perform a tarot reading for each spouse. The player is given a three-card "Past, Present, Future" spread, and the order in which you place each character's cards determines the endings for that character.
