### About

Dogs Day is a 2D narrative-driven adventure game. You play as a reclusive PhD student who gets brought out of his shell after meeting three lost dogs. The game loop consists of finding a special item for each dog and bringing it to a specific location, which will trigger an event that leads to the dog finding its way home.
