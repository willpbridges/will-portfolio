### Lessons & Takeaways

Habit of Force gave me valuable experience in joining a project midway through
development and having to read and comprehend a large codebase to get up to speed. It was intimidating at first, but I soon gained a pretty solid understanding of the code and figured out what worked and what didn't. I was then able to take this knowledge and make progress on my first action items, eventually improving the existing functionality and then adding new mechanics to the gameplay. Two freshmen programmers were brought on at the same time as me, and I helped them understand the codebase so they could accomplish their assigned tasks. Development had been paused while the game transitioned to the new development team, so being able to make tangible progress and leave our mark on the game felt great.
