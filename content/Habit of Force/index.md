### Lessons & Takeaways

Working on Habit of Force has been an interesting and unique experience. I appreciate the vision Brandon has for this game, and it felt really good to make progress after development had been paused. All the previous programmers left the project or had to take a break due to school, so when I and two others were brought on, I was suddenly the senior programmer. This was intimidating at first, but with enough time reading the codebase and tinkering with the game, we were able to implement new gameplay functionality and get it ready for BostonFIG. You often need to read through and comprehend a large codebase when starting a new software job, so I appreciate the experience I gained in that department, in addition to the Unity practice and being able to showcase my work at a festival.
