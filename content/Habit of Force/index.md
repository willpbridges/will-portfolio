### Contributions
* Preparing the game to be showcased at the Boston Festival of Indie Games and Tokyo Indies
* Independently reading and understanding the large pre-existing codebase
* Tracking down and fixing bugs in scripts to bring the game to a playable state
* Implementing battle animations, UI elements, and different mech attack types
* Filling out missing or broken functionality in scripts and adding new functionality based on code already in place
* Helping onboard junior developers and holding project meetings to work together on implementing gameplay features

### Lessons & Takeaways

Working on Habit of Force has been an interesting and unique experience. I appreciate the vision Brandon has for this game, and it felt really good to make progress after development had been paused. All the previous programmers left the project or had to take a break due to school, so when I and two others were brought on, I was suddenly the senior programmer. This was intimidating at first, but with enough time reading the codebase and tinkering with the game, we were able to implement new gameplay functionality and get it ready for BostonFIG. You often need to read through and comprehend a large codebase when starting a new software job, so I appreciate the experience I gained in that department, in addition to the Unity practice and being able to showcase my work at a festival.
