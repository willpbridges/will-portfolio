### About
Over the course of my senior year, I worked remotely with three other team members to design and program a complete, polished game in Unity for our game design capstone class. The result was Road Trip: a first-person, narrative-based adventure game with laid-back driving gameplay. Road Trip features the following:
* A charming narrative with a compelling mystery 
* Adorable animal characters
* Automatic and manual driving modes, which you can switch between at any time
* An interactive dashboard with 4 radio stations, each one featuring a different song from our original soundtrack
* Good vibes

### Contributions
* Writing C# scripts to create the pathfinding system for automatic driving and designing the pathways on each route
* Playtesting and fixing bugs before each build submission for in-class milestones
* Refocusing team throughout the year when we lost track of our core design goals or became too focused on issues that didn't need to be primary concerns
* Collaborating remotely over Zoom and Discord throughout school year
* Reaching out to our composer to secure original music for game
